# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: April 26, 2021*

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly in all of our apps — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

Paid account owners can cancel their active subscriptions via the [Account page in the CreatorsArea](https://www.pocketcity.app/creators/account). Alternatively, account can be deleted from the Profile Menu within PocketCITY.

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, [contact us](mailto:matt.gogan@pocketcity.app). We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel an account?

You won’t be able to access your paid features once you cancel, so make sure you download everything you want to keep beforehand. 

We make no promises of the accessibility of your data after cancellation.  Data for inactive accounts may be wiped without notice. Retrieving content for a single account from a backup isn’t possible.  **Content can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.**

We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle, [contact us](mailto:matt.gogan@pocketcity.app) for a [fair refund](../refund/index.md). We’ll treat you right.

## PocketCITY-initiated cancellations

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period:
* For frozen accounts: 180 days after being frozen due to billing failures
* For free accounts: after 365 days of inactivity

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](../terms/index.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](../abuse/index.md).
